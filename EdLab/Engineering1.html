										<h2>Machine Learning</h3>
										<p>Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use 
										of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key
										insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications 
										and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.</p>

										<h2>Algorithm</h2>
										<p>In computing, algorithms provide computers with a successive guide to completing actions. Theyâ€™re comprised of 
										a precise list of instructions that outline exactly how to complete a task. Algorithms are used throughout all areas 
										of IT and computing. They can manipulate and process data and perform calculations or actions in various ways.</p>

										<h2>Java</h2>
										<p>Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications, 
										big data processing, embedded systems, and so on. According to Oracle, the company that owns Java, Java runs on 3 
										billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

										<h2>Python</h2>
										<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level
										built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application 
										Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, 
										easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. </p>
